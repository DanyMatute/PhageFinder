PATCHES
-------

Suggested updates should be directed to Derrick Fouts (dfouts@jcvi.org) for consideration.
04/09/2012:  Fixed a bug in the Perl module Phage_subs_v2.pm that prevented the proper creation and usage of the phage_finder_info.txt file when providing a Genbank .ptt file.
          :  Corrected HMM3_searches.pl (hmm3search changed to hmmsearch).
          :  phage_finder_v2.1.sh now checks for correct hmmsearch version.  Errors out if not "HMMER 3"

INTRODUCTION
------------

Phage_Finder is a heuristic computer program written in PERL that uses BLASTP data, HMM results, and tRNA/tmRNA information to find prophage regions in complete bacterial genome sequences.  For more information please visit the Phage_Finder website at http://phage-finder.sourceforge.net/

PHAGE_FINDER PIPELINE
---------------------

To run the complete Phage_Finder pipeline automaticly, you need to have the following:

1) each genome within a directory that is named by accession or contig_id (ie NC_000913) (see examples_dir)
2) protein sequences for each genome in their repective directories with extension (.pep or .faa)
3) phage_finder_info.txt or GenBank .ptt file in their repective directories
4) complete genome sequence (.con or .fna file) in their repective directories

% Phage_Finder_v2.1.sh <file with list of accessions>

10) #phgbp = The size (in base pairs) of the prophage region
11) Ty = Region type (PRO=prophage, BAC=bacteriocin, DEG=degenerate, IEL=integrated element)
12) class = Region class (LRG=large, MED=medium, SML=small, SAT=satellite, RET=retron element, Mu=Mu-like, P2=P2-like, P4=P4-like)
13) att = Predicted attachment site found (Y/N)
14) target = Predicted target of insertion
15) In = The number of integrase HMM hits
